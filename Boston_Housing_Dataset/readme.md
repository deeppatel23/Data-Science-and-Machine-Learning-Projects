4. Boston Housing Data Set
This is another popular dataset used in pattern recognition literature. The data set comes from the real estate industry in Boston (US). This is a regression problem. The data has 506 rows and 14 columns. Thus, it’s a fairly small data set where you can attempt any technique without worrying about your laptop’s memory being overused.

Problem: Predict the median value of owner occupied homes.

Conclusion : Here we will learn how to test different graph at a time and how to reduce the length of our code and also we will visulize through graphs real value vs predicted value.
